## 1. Introduction and Context

Agility is a very young sport and is still in a state of rapid evolution. Besides changes in rules, course design, obstacles, and handling techniques, significant evolution is also occurring off the ring. In recent years, we have witnessed the proliferation of numerous new platforms for competition management.

During the development of a competition, we identified two main needs that we knew we could meet:
- Eliminate human error in transcribing timing results.
- Provide the helper team with remote control of the timer integrated with the platform, thus avoiding the need for multiple screens.

Since its inception in 2018, ZonEcron Timer has offered several ways to configure and operate it. We decided to make our communication system public, allowing platforms to interface directly with the timer.

- The timer also sends information when the time for a course walk countdown or course start countdown expires.
- The software can send information on faults, refusals, and eliminations.
- The software can initiate a course walk countdown or a course start countdown.
- The software can reset the timer at any moment.
